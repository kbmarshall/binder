    "In this lab we will look at adding vectors, both experimentally and analytically in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Experimental Procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "On your lab bench is a force table with four pulleys.  Strings are attached to a ring at the center, and then run over the pulley to a hanging mass.  In this lab, we will use the mass attached to each string (along with the direction of the string) as a vector to add.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mount a pulley on the table at the 35$^{\\circ}$ mark, and suspend a total of 55 grams from the string.  Note the plastic hangers have a mass of 5 grams.  This is force $\\vec{A}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suspend a total of 155 grams from the 130$^{\\circ}$ mark of the table.  This is force $\\vec{B}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suspend a total of 75 grams from the 200$^{\\circ}$ mark of the table.  This is force $\\vec{C}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in this lab is to find the fourth vector $\\vec{D}$ such that the net force will be zero, or in other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{A} + \\vec{B} + \\vec{C} + \\vec{D} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using a process of trial and error, find the magnitude and direction necessary for the fourth pulley $\\vec{D}$ such that the net force is zero. The ring should be centered on the force table, and displacing it by a small amount should return it to center.  There should be no directional preference in which way the ring wants to move.  If there is, add/subtract mass to the fourth pulley or change the angle by a small amount.  Once the system is in equilibrium, record the magnitude (in units of grams) and direction of this vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find the experimental uncertainty in both the magnitude and direction of $\\vec{D}$ by observing the effect of small changes in both the weight and direction of this force.  Start by adding a small amount of mass to $\\vec{D}$ until you find the maximum amount at which the system is still in equilibrium.  Then remove mass until you find the minimum amount which will still balance the system.  This will give you the uncertainty in the magnitude of $\\vec{D}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In a similar fashion, change the angle of $\\vec{D}$ until the system is no longer in equilibrium, first by increasing the angle and then decreasing it. This will give you an estimate for the uncertainty in the angle of $\\vec{D}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will calculate the sum of all four vectors, and see if their sum is consistent with zero (within the uncertainties).  Just like any other vectors, we will calculate the sum by breaking the vectors into components and then adding the components.  If the sum of all four vectors is zero, that means both the x-component and the y-components of the sum should be zero as well.\n",

    "### Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, a function is something which takes an input, performs some calculation, and then spits out a value.  For example, $y(x) = 3x^2$ will take a value for $x$, square it, multiply it by 3, and then that value is $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, functions work much the same way.  You give the function one or more variables, the function does something with those variables, and then returns one or more numbers to whatever called the function.  Functions can also return text or other objects, but we won't use that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are great if you need to perform something multiple times.  Instead of having the same (potentially lengthy) block of code 10 times, you can define a function and then call the function 10 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a function, use the command `def` followed by the name of the function, and then a pair of parenthesis.  Within the parenthesis you can define any values which the function would use.  The next line, which must be indented using a tab or space, contains your function.  At the end you should have a return statement, which will send the output of the function back to whatever called it.\n",
