    "In this lab we will look at the momentum and kinetic energy of two motion carts as they collide.\n",
    "\n",
    "A moving object has a momentum $\\vec{p} = m \\vec{v}$ (which is a vector) and kinetic energy $K = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2$ (which is a scalar.  When two objects collide, they exert a force on each other for a short period of time.  The result of this force is an impulse - a change in momentum for each cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are no outside forces acting on the two carts, the total momentum of the system should remain unchanged.  However the kinetic energy does not need to remain constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the kinetic energy is conserved, we say the collision is *elastic*.  The motion carts you will use have magnets which repel each other.  Although this type of collision is not perfectly elastic, it should be fairly close.\n",
    "\n",
    "If kinetic energy is lost in the collision, we say the collision is *inelastic*.  The maximum amount of energy that can be lost occurs when the two carts stick together.  In that case we refer to the collision as *perfectly inelastic*.\n",

    "In this lab we will look at a variety of collisions between two carts, and see if both kinetic energy and momentum are conserved.\n",

    "#### Appendix:  Uncertainties\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far in lab we have seen a number of ways to measure uncertainty in a given quantity.  These include the standard deviation for repeated measurements (The Not-So-Simple Pendulum), experimentally (Vectors, and Revenge of the Pendulum), and also by varying quantities one at a time (Vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, if we have one or more values which have an uncertainty, and we are trying to calculate the uncertainty for a calculation which involves those values, we can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiplying or dividing by a constant**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x$ equal some measurement, and $\\delta x$ is its uncertainty.  If we simply want to multiply or divide $x$ by a constant, we also multiply or divide $\\delta x$ by the same constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "$$ y = 3x $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\delta y = 3 \\delta x $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the uncertainty in $y$ is 3 times the uncertainty in $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adding *or* subtracting two values**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are adding or subtracting two numbers, we always add their uncertainties.  This is because the uncertainty in a given quantity can only get larger when combining values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = x - y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta z = \\delta x + \\delta y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiplying *or* dividing two values**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are multiplying or dividing two numbers, we add their *fractional* uncertainty instead.  The fractional uncertainty is simply the uncertainty in a value divided by the value itself.  The sum will give us the fractional uncertainty in the result.  Like above, it doesn't matter if we are multiplying or dividing - the fractional uncertainty should only get larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = x \\times y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\delta z}{z} = \\frac{\\delta x}{x} + \\frac{\\delta y}{y} \\rightarrow \\delta z = z \\left( \\frac{\\delta x}{x} + \\frac{\\delta y}{y} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are talking about momentum, we can simplify this expression a bit:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta p = p \\left( \\frac{\\delta m}{m} + \\frac{\\delta v}{v} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And since $p=mv$, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta p = mv \\left( \\frac{\\delta m}{m} + \\frac{\\delta v}{v} \\right) = v~\\delta m + m~\\delta v$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exponents**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are raising a number to some power (which can be positive or negative, or greater or less than one), the fractional uncertainty in the result is equal to the fractional uncertainty in the original measurement, multiplied by the absolute value of that power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = x^n$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\delta y}{y} = |n| \\frac{\\delta x}{x}$$\n",
