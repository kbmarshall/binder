    "### JupyterLab and Markdown - A brief introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Documents (such as this one) in JupyterLab are referred to as \"notebooks.\"  Notebooks consist of \"cells,\" of which there are two types:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Markdown**, which is used to write plain text (like this)\n",
    " * **Code**, which is used to perform some type of computation\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a notebook, the markdown cells inside are usually \"rendered.\"  This means the markdown has been processed to show the intended output.  You can view the markdown code by double clicking on a cell (try it on this one).  Once you make changes to a cell, you can either press shift+Enter to evaluate the cell, or click on the \"Play\" arrow at the top of the notebook (try it now).  To evaluate all cells, click on the double-arrow at the top of the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new cell, click on the \"Plus\" sign at the top of the notebook.  A new cell can take one of two possible formats:  markdown or code.  A code cell will have an empty pair of square brackets just to the left.  If you wish to convert this to a markdown cell, enter the cell and then choose \"Markdown\" from the menu just above your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of your lab report will be written in markdown, although the actual data entry and calculations during lab will be done in python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try a simple command in a code cell:"

    "* Attached to your lab table you will find a pendulum.  Measure the length of the string, and either wind or unwind some string to get it as close to 1.5 meters as possible.\n",

After releasing it, use the stopwatch to measure the period of the pendulum ten times.  (**note:** do not measure the period for ten oscillations, instead measure the period of a single oscillation ten times)\n",

    "### Writing equations in Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "For entering equations in markdown, you can use LaTeX equation format.  LaTeX is a typesetting language which allows a *huge* amount of control over the publishing of scientific and technical documents.  It is commonly used in the physical sciences and mathematics.  Thankfully we are only going to use the mathematical equation formattting capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any equation in LaTeX should be enclosed by $ signs (either one or two at each end).  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A = B+C$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = B+C$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the raw markdown code and make sure you understand the difference between the two formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equations are (relatively) simple to enter in LaTeX format.  Superscripts and subscripts are denoted by ^ and _ respectively.  If you have more than one character which is sub- or super-script, it should be enclosed by curly braces.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^23_i,j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "vs.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^{23}_{i,j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Greek letters are denoted by a backslash, and then the name of the letter.  For capital greek letters, begin the letter name with a capital as well.  For example, $\\delta$ and $\\Delta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a fraction, use the \\frac command followed by two pairs of curly braces - one for the numerator and one for the denominator.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = \\frac{x}{y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to put parenthesis around a fraction, they will be too small:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = ( \\frac{x}{y})^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can use \\left( and \\right) which will tell LaTeX to automatically size the parenthesis to whatever is inside.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z = \\left( \\frac{x}{y} \\right)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical functions are usually prefaced by a backslash, for example $\\sin$, $\\log$ or $\\sqrt{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For vectors, use \\vec followed by a pair of curly braces for the actual vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{F} = m\\vec{a}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That covers most of the basics. It's easy once you get the hang of it. If you forget some of the symbols or commands, you can find a cheat sheet [here](http://tug.ctan.org/info/undergradmath/undergradmath.pdf).\n",
